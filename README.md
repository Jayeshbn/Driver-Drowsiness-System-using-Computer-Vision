# Driver-sleep-detection-and-alarming-system-using-Computer-Vision
This project is to develop a system that can detect the drowsiness of the driver and make alarms accordingly using Computer Vision. It is developed in MATLAB and we have used image processing algorithm also known as Viola Jones algorithm for detection of faces and eyes, the image of eye is continously processed and the ratio of black pixels to white pixels is calculated and based on the bw ratio, the alarm beeps if driver is asleep.
